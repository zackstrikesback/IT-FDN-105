1. Which of the followings is considered boxing?

a. double dblx = fx;
b. float fx = ix;
c. object myobjx = fx; BOXING
d. int ix = objy;

2. Which of the followings is considered unboxing?

a. string str = ix.ToString();
b. double dblx = (double) fx;
c. object myobjx = fx;
d. int ix = (int) objy; UNBOXING

3. Object objdblx is of type double. Assign the value of this object to a variable of type float.

float fx = (float) (double) objdblx;

4. Object objflx is of type float. Assign the value of this object o another variable of type double.

double dx = (double) (float) objflx;

5. Convert the string strx to a double dblx:

double dblx = double.Parse(strx);

6. Convert the integer ix to a float fx:

float fx = ix;

7. Convert the double dblx to a string strx:

string strx = dblx.ToString();

8. Object is the BASE class of all other data types.

9. What is an object (the definition)?
	A value that has properties and functionality.

10. How do you declare an object in C#?
